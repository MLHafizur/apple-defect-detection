# apple-defect-detection
Dataset containing 244 images of defected apples (along with their XML annotation files) have been uploaded. Training set contains 218 images while the test set contains 26 images. The dimensions for all the images are 280X400. 

The following two jupyter notebooks have also been uploaded:

1. A Jupyter notebook, called `Apple_Defect_Detection_SSD.ipynb`, is uploaded which presents the experiment to detect *apple defects* using the SSD based detector. 

2. Another Jupyter notebook, called `Apple_Defect_Detection_using_Darkflow_Yolov2.ipynb`, is uploaded which presents the experiment to detect *apple defects* using the YOLOv2 based detector.
