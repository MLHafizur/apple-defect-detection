# apple-defect-detection
Dataset containing 244 images of defected apples (along with their XML annotation files) have been uploaded. Training set contains 218 images while the test set contains 26 images. The dimensions for all the images are 280X400. 

1. A Jupyter notebook is uploaded which presents the experiment to detect *apple defects* using the [TensorFlows' Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). This notebook is named as `Apple_Defect_Detection.ipynb`.

2. Another Jupyter notebook is uploaded which presents the experiment to detect *apple defects* using the [YOLO v2 Darkflow API](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow). This notebook is named as `Apple_Defect_Detection_using_Darkflow_Yolov2.ipynb`.
